#  Data Engineering - Air Pollution

## Objective

To analyze the high concentrations of various pollutants throughout the crop fields of the United States. 

## Data
30 years of air quality, geographical, and statistical data is drawn from CSVs provided by the United States EPA. While the AQS website references the specifics for each of the fields in the database, a brief overview will be given below of the type of data one can expect from the database 

### Pollutant Info
Quantities of nitrogen oxide among various other pollutants were measured with sample durations, units of measure, pollutant types, and collection methods recorded. 

### Geographical Info
Latitude and longitude are both included on top of state, county, city, and address for monitoring sites.

### Statistical Info
Some of the highest values of the year were collected along with statistical means, medians, standard deviations, and percentiles.

Sample snapshots of the database and data types used for various fields are provided to give the user a sense of the presentation and format with which the database is displayed.

## Ethical Considerations
Data referenced throughout the projected was collected from the US EPA and FSA websites which are referenced below. Supplementary information on pollution facts as they pertain to crop yields are referenced below to give supporting material for our objective. While the fields and rows in the end product were mostly preserved to keep true to their original source, information on US territories were omitted in order to stay consistent with the farm information provided, and columns 38 - 41 & 55 from the concentration by monitor CSVs were also omitted.
