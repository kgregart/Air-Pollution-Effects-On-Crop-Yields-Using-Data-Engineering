AIR_ POLLUTION

To analyze the high concentrations of various pollutants that mark visibles markings of injury throughout the crops fields of the united states. 

DATA
â€¢	Data Contains A Collection Of 20-Years Of Data Collection (Cs Files) From All 50 States. Each Files Contains State Code, County Code, Parameter, Latitude, Longitude, Datum, Pollutant Standard, Metric Use,  Method, Year, Units Of Measure Etc. The Data frame Contains Over 1,000 Variables Of Information

GENERATE DATAFRAMES FROM CSV
Utility Function, Directory And Csv File A List Of Data frames Containing Contents Of Each Csv Per Data frame 

POLLUTANTS
Calculate The Amount Of Pollutant Of Nitrogen Oxide Across A Specified List Of Monitors Across United States.

OBSERVATIONS
Reads A Directory Of Files And Reports The Number The Complete Observation Of Cases In Each Data File. The Function Returns A Data Frame Of Where The File Is Displaying A Picture Of What Is Going On In That Particular Year.

ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS
The Data Files Explain The Ethical Standards Of The Cases And Its Calculations And Correlation Between The Health Of Crops And Nitrogen Oxide For The Monitor Of Locations/States.

 Air Pollution To The Public Is Essential To Reducing The Exposure  But Overall, May Lead To Unethical Behavior. According To The Findings Within The Data frame  The Experimental Studies Indicate That Exposure Physically And Mentally Are Linked To Partial Finding Ethical Versus Unethical Behavior. Nitrogen Oxides Are Widely Used Pollutant That Can Affect Crops Positively And Negatively That Placed Drastic Measurements On Agriculture Productively. The Admittance Of This Pollutant Can Lead A Production Level For Any Individual To An Increase Leading Level Economically. Increasing Yields From 15% In Harsh Weather Conditions And As Well 25% In Mass Production Weather Conditions.
