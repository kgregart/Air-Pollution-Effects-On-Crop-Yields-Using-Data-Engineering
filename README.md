#  Air Pollution Effects On Crop Yields Using Data Engineering

## Background

Agriculture crops are damaged when exposed to high concentrations of various pollutants ultimately reducing food production. Crop damage has been the result of common air pollutants causing crop damage which come from various sources such as household cleaning VOCs, industrial processes and equipment, transportation agriculture and energy generatation. Spefically, research led by David Lobell found significant declines in crop yields when exposed to high amounts of nitrogen oxides pollution.  Understanding trends on where the highest concentration of nitrogen oxide levels exist can empower the NGO's and local farmers to advocate clean air reform to reduce sources creating high nitrogen oxide levels.
 

## Objective

Develop an database for each U.S. county containing air pollutant concentration levels for each pollutant category for NGO's to analyze the high concentrations of various pollutants throughout the crop fields of the United States. 

## Data Collectied
30 years of air quality, geographical, and statistical data were drawn from a collection of CSVs provided by the United States EPA. While the AQS website references the specifics for each of the fields in the database, a brief overview will be given below of the type of data one can expect from the database. 

Sample snapshots of the database and data types used for various fields are provided to give the user a sense of the presentation and format with which the database is displayed.

## Ethical Considerations
Data referenced throughout the projected was collected from the US EPA and FSA websites which are referenced below. Supplementary information on pollution facts as they pertain to crop yields are referenced below to give supporting material for our objective. While the fields and rows in the end product were mostly preserved to keep true to their original source, information on US territories were omitted in order to stay consistent with the farm information provided, and columns 38 - 41 & 55 from the concentration by monitor CSVs were also omitted.
